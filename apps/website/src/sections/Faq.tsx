        q: "Is this the same as Ethereum mainnet?",
        a: `No. ${site.chainName} is an independent Layer-1 with chain ID 4111. It uses EVM bytecode and JSON-RPC, but ${site.nativeSymbol} and deployed contracts are not automatically bridged to Ethereum unless you build a bridge.`,
      },
      {
        q: "What consensus does the network use?",
        a: "Geth Clique Proof of Authority (PoA). A configured set of validators sign blocks on a ~3 second schedule. There is no mining or staking slashing like proof-of-stake mainnet.",
      },
      {
        q: "How fast are transaction confirmations?",
        a: "Transactions are included in the next sealed block — typically within ~3 seconds. PoA finality is immediate at inclusion; there is no long probabilistic confirmation window.",
      },
      {
        q: "What is the block gas limit?",
        a: "30,000,000 gas per block (genesis default). Complex contracts must fit within this limit per block; heavy deployments may need optimization or constructor splitting.",
      },
      {
        q: "Can the chain be restarted without losing data?",
        a: "Yes, in production. Geth persists to disk via Docker volumes. In development, use Anvil persistent state or Geth — not ephemeral Hardhat, which resets on every restart.",

    ],
  },
  {
    title: "Rates, gas & fees",
    items: [
      {
        q: "How are transaction fees calculated?",
        a: `Fee = gas used × gas price, paid in native ${site.nativeSymbol}. Wallets estimate gas before signing. The live gas price is shown on this site and in the explorer dashboard, read from the node via eth_feeHistory / getFeeData.`,
      },
      {
        q: `Why does the site show a USD price for ${site.nativeSymbol}?`,
        a: "The USD figure is a reference index (external ETH spot) used only to illustrate gas costs in familiar units. It is not an on-chain oracle and does not represent a listed market price for ECNA unless you operate an exchange.",
      },
      {
        q: "How much does a simple transfer cost?",
        a: "A standard native transfer uses 21,000 gas. Multiply by the current gas price in Gwei to get the fee in ECNA. The Rates & fees section on this page calculates this live.",
      },
      {
        q: "Are EIP-1559 priority fees supported?",
        a: "The node exposes maxFeePerGas and maxPriorityFeePerGas fields. On many PoA networks the effective price is stable and low; wallets may still send type-2 transactions.",
      },
      {
        q: "What affects gas cost for smart contracts?",
        a: "Storage writes, external calls, loop length, and contract size all increase gas. Deploy costs are highest; reads are cheapest. Always test on a dev node before mainnet deployment.",

  {
    title: "Wallets & users",
    items: [
      {
        q: "Can I use MetaMask or Trust Wallet?",
        a: "Yes. Add a custom EVM network with chain ID 4111, your RPC URL, and ECNA as the currency symbol. Copy values from the Wallet configuration or Network reference sections.",
      },
      {
        q: "Where do I get test ECNA?",
        a: "Genesis and treasury scripts fund operator accounts in development. On a live deployment, request funds from your network operator or use a faucet if one is published.",
      },
      {
        q: "What is the difference between the dashboard and the explorer?",
        a: "The explorer is read-only — search blocks, transactions, and contracts. The dashboard connects your wallet (MetaMask / WalletConnect) so you can sign and send transactions.",
      },
      {
        q: "Is the website login the same as my wallet?",
        a: "No. Register / log in on this site is for marketing hub accounts only. Your on-chain identity is your wallet address and private keys — never enter seed phrases on this website.",

  {
    title: "Developers",
    items: [
      {
        q: "Which tools can I use to deploy contracts?",
        a: "Hardhat and Foundry are supported. Set chainId 4111 and your RPC URL in hardhat.config or foundry.toml. The contracts workspace includes PETH UUPS deploy scripts.",
      },
      {
        q: "How do I verify source code?",
        a: "After deployment, open Verify Contract in ECNASCAN. Provide compiler version, optimization runs, SPDX license, and constructor arguments matching the deployment transaction.",
      },
      {
        q: "Does the API require authentication for reads?",
        a: "Public read endpoints (blocks, transactions, search, dashboard) are open for the explorer. Rate limiting applies in production. Write operations and account features use separate auth.",
      },
      {
        q: `What is ${T20}?`,
        a: `${T20} refers to ERC-20 style tokens on this chain — including the optional PETH token deployed via the contracts package. Transfers are indexed and visible on address and token pages.`,
      },
      {
        q: "How do I point my dApp at the network?",
        a: `Use ethers.js or viem with JsonRpcProvider pointing at your RPC URL and chainId 4111. For frontends, set VITE_* URLs to the public API and explorer hosts.`,

  {
    title: "Explorer, indexer & operations",
    items: [
      {
        q: "Where is blockchain data stored?",
        a: "Canonical state is on the Geth node. ECNASCAN indexes blocks, transactions, and token transfers into MS SQL Server for fast search and analytics.",
      },
      {
        q: "Why might the explorer lag behind the chain tip?",
        a: "The indexer processes blocks sequentially. During catch-up or heavy load, indexed block height can trail RPC chainHead. The live stats banner shows lag in blocks when present.",
      },
      {
        q: "Should JSON-RPC be public on the internet?",
        a: "No for production validators. Firewall port 8545 to trusted IPs (indexer, deployers). Public users should use the explorer and API, not your raw node.",
      },
      {
        q: "How do I run the full stack locally?",
        a: "Start a node (Geth Docker, Anvil, or Hardhat), then npm run local:stack from the repo root for API, indexer, explorer, and dashboard. See SETUP_NEW_LAPTOP.txt in the repository.",
      },
      {
        q: "What ports need to be open in production?",
        a: "Typically 443 (HTTPS) for explorer, dashboard, API, and website. RPC 8545 should not be public. SQL Server stays on a private network accessible only to API/indexer.",
